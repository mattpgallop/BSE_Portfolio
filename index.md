# 3-Joint Robotic Arm with Claw
My project is a robotic arm that can pivot at three different points, and it has a claw that can grab things. The arm is controlled by two joysticks which are connected to the Arduino in the base of the arm, which then sends information to the servos that cause the arm to move.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up the servos in my kit to an Arduino and then controlling them. First, I had to download the Arduino software to my computer, plug in my Arduino, and then connect the correct ports on my Arduino to the servo (ground, 5V, and a digital pin). I then had to figure out how to get the servo to move, so I used the internet to find out how to write some very basic code. When I got the servo to move, I noticed I could only turn it off by unplugging it from my computer, so I quickly realized my next step was figuring out how to use a button to turn it on and off. This part took me a while, and I had to go through a lot of trial and error to get it to work the way I wanted it to. After I got the button to work, I quickly moved on to control the servo with a joystick; I used two analog pins on my Arduino to map one servo to the x-axis and another servo to the y-axis. I then wrote some code for the Arduino to detect whenever the joystick went past a certain range, and if it did, it would send a signal to one of the servos to move. At first, the code I wrote was very clunky, and I wasn't able to move the servos how I wanted; however, by changing the amount the servo moved and the time in between the rotations, I was able to fix this.
