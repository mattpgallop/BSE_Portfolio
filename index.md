# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up the servos in my kit to an Arduino. First, I had to download the Arduino software to my computer, plug in my Arduino, and then connect the correct ports on my Arduino to the servo (ground, 5V, and a digital pin). I then had to figure out how to get the servo to move, so I used the internet to find out how to write some very basic code. When I got the servo to move, I noticed I could only turn it off by unplugging it from my computer, so I quickly realized my next step was figuring out how to use a button to turn it on and off. This part took me a while, and I had to go through a lot of trial and error to get it to work the way I wanted it to. What I found was that some methods were easier to do but were less responsive, and others were more complicated but ended in a better final result. I ended up using a digital pin to detect high and low voltage and only having the servo move when the Arduino detected high voltage. However, the button was only a temporary solution, as I am going to use a joystick with my final project.
